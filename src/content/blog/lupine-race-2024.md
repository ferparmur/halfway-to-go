It's 10:30 AM on a sunny summer morning when my wife and I make it to the courtyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, just next to Trafalgar Square in London. We're early and we took of the tube one stop early, in Embankment, taking the chance to buy an expensive coffee along the way. Once we arrive I'm reminded that my entry fee gave us access to refreshments, including coffee, for free. Oh well, the route hasn't already started and I'm already making costly mistakes.

We're waiting here until 11:45, when the 2024 edition of the Lupine Race starts. What's the [Lupine Race](https://www.lupine.co.uk/race/), you might ask? In a nutshell, it's a race across Europe using only overland public transport. No airplanes, no cars, just good ol' trains, buses and ferries. To preclude participants from planning a route in advance, the route must pass through several intermediate checkpoints, which are only revealed just when the race starts.

The first edition of the race took place in 2023, going from London to Istanbul, and I sadly only learnt about it after it had happened through [Simon Calder's chronicle in The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/race-europe-london-istanbul-public-transport-b2391611.html). I immediately searched the event online and signed up for the second edition, which was going to span the 1,175 mi / 1,892 km from London to Tirana.

## The Checkpoint Reveal
My wife patiently sits with me waiting for the race to start. I'm quite nervous and while other racers start pouring in and meeting each other, and just silently contemplating the red envelope containing the race pack, which we are strictly prohibited to open until the race kicks off. In there, of course, are the locations of the intermediate checkpoints.

5 minutes before the start, Race Director James Finnerty comes to stage. This year's race theme is film, and the story behind the route is that a certain famous Austrian bodybuilder-turned-movie-star has lost the script for his latest movie, _The Albanian Connection_. Each of the 180 participants in the race will need to pick up one line from the script in the first checkpoint, Bruges (we knew about this location beforehand, otherwise getting a seat in the Eurostar would have been impossible). 

We'll then need to do some location scouting at the next checkpoint, and we can choose between:
* The Contra Dam, in Switzerland, where 007 does an impressive bungee jump stunt in the opening of _Goldeneye_.
* The Pl√∂nlein in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany, featured in _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_
* The iconic Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin, seen in _Run, Lola, Run_.

After that, all the racers must go through the Austrian city of Graz, and deliver their script line at the Palais-Hotel Erzherzog Johann, right in the city centre.

From there, we are allowed to choose once again between two possible checkpoints:
* The Grand Hotel in Rimini, in the Adriatic Coast of Italy
* Union Square in Timisoara, Romania.

We'll then end the race in Tirana, the Albanian capital, in a space just next to Skandeberg Square, the main plaza in the centre of the city.

I realise checkpoints this year are in indirect locations, most of them requiring noticeable detours from the shortest route to Tirana. That should be fun. I don't have much time to think about the checkpoints now (_Rothenburg-ob-derwhat? Where in Romania is Timisoara?_), as the race starts and we need to GO, GO, GO!

## London - Bruges
It's 11:45 and I start running among other racers towards the Leicester Square Tube station. I have a seat booked in the next Eurostar train departing for Brussels, scheduled at 13:01. I have plenty of time to get to St Pancras, as the ticket gates only close 30 minutes before departure (in practice it's often later than that, but don't use that advice and then blame me when you miss your train). I still run, however, for two reasons: 1) I have been building up adrenaline while waiting for the race to start, and 2) the sooner I can sit down and start planning my route, the better.

I don't have to wait much for a Piccadilly Line Train, and thanks to the rollout of 5G in the Underground tunnels, I can start planning my route. The first leg is already planned and quite easy: ride on the aforementioned Eurostar to Brussels Midi, and from there make a 14-minute connection to a Belgian Intercity to Bruges. I know I'm going to need to push my way out of the Eurostar platform in Brussels, as the only way out are a couple of lifts and a small staircase, but I think I should be able to make it if there aren't delays on the Eurostar.

If all goes to plan, I should reach the checkpoint in the centre of Bruges by 18:00. I even have already bought a local bus ticket to get there from the train station.

Of all the possible choices of second checkpoint, my favourite is the Contra Dam, as I vaguely remember it from the film and I'm sure it has to be quite spectacular. It is also close on the map to Graz, and the Swiss route is much more reliable than others as the trains there run on time, which can definitely not be said about Germany. Of course, I promptly confirm my suspicions: the dam is in too remote of a location to make this a viable option if I want to try winning the race.

Berlin is quite far away, but of course offers excellent connections, including night trains to get there. The more scenic route, via Rothenburg, is more direct, but requires more connections.

There's no much time to keep researching, though: the train arrives to King's Cross St. Pancras and is time to get out of the tube. It brings back memories of morning rush commutes, switching from the Victoria to the Northern Line among hundreds of people through the tunnel maze. Even if it's Saturday, it's no different this time, but I manage to push my way and climb on the left side of the escalators, silently cursing the tourists on their way to Platform 9 3/4 that don't seem to be aware of the dozen signs telling them to stand on the right. Still, when I check my watch it's 12:02. Fantastic.

It doesn't take long to pass security, and thanks to my Spanish passport I'm able to skip the line for non-EU citizens on the French immigration controls. I manage to skim through the dozens of people in line to board the train to Paris, go to buy a bottle of water (not carrying one from home is my second costly mistake), and manage to find a seat where I can take my laptop out and plan the itinerary in earnest. Surprisingly, the station WiFi is working just fine, although a bit slow, as you would expect. In these crowds, phone data just doesn't work, so I have to be patient.

You maybe surprised that I'm carrying a laptop in a race, where packing light is essential, but I think it has helped me greatly. I'm still only travelling with a small backpack and there's so much more than I'm able to get done with a big screen and a keyboard as opposed to just a phone.

Anyway, by the time boarding for my train opens, I have the first part of my plan: I'm going to go via Rothenburg. It'll involve a night bus from Belgium to Germany, and a lot of trains within Germany, which is not ideal, but I prefer the route to the Berlin option, as Rothenburg looks lovely and I've never been there before. The multiple connections and shorter total distance are a plus, too.

As soon as I find my seat on the Eurostar, I plug my phone charger: I can't afford not to charge my phone, battery pack, laptop, or earbuds (in that order of priority) at any chance I have. A couple of minutes later, the fellow sitting next to me comes in, and making his way to his window seat immediately destroys my USB adaptor with one of his legs. Thank God I carry a spare.

The bad news onboard the train is that there is no phone reception whatsoever, and the train WiFi isn't working at all for me. I just wait anxiously for the train to depart, hoping to get some signal when we depart the stations, watching the clock and pointlessly trying to refresh pages in the meantime.

I sigh in relief when the train departs on time, and through the journey I manage to plan most of my route to Tirana, switching from the train WiFi to my phone's data and back, and refreshing everything a dozen times until it works. I even miraculously manage to pay for a night bus ticket from inside the Channel Tunnel. And all of this while my seat companion, an American visiting Europe for the first time, keeps asking questions about trains, borders and such, and remarking how cool it'd be to drive his car (which I can only imagine to be some sort of [massive pick up truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nZh7A7qTPo)) as fast as the the train goes.

At 16:38, we arrive into Brussels Midi, and I jump off the train and try to overtake as many people as possible. My memories of the station were right and there's a massive chokepoint exiting the Eurostar area, but I manage to get to the platform for my train to Bruges
