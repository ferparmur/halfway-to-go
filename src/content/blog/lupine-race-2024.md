It’s 10:30 AM on a sunny summer morning when my wife and I arrive at the courtyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, just next to Trafalgar Square in London. We're early, having gotten off the Tube one stop early at Embankment, which gave us the chance to buy an expensive coffee along the way. Once we arrive, I'm reminded that my entry fee covered refreshments, including coffee, for free. Oh well, the race hasn't even started, and I'm already making costly mistakes.

We're waiting here until 11:45, when the 2024 edition of the Lupine Race begins. What’s the [Lupine Race](https://www.lupine.co.uk/race/), you might ask? In a nutshell, it’s a race across Europe using only overland public transport. No airplanes, no cars—just good ol' trains, buses, and ferries. To prevent participants from planning their route in advance, the race requires them to pass through several intermediate checkpoints, which are only revealed when the race begins.

The first edition of the race took place in 2023, going from London to Istanbul. Unfortunately, I only learned about it after it had happened through [Simon Calder's chronicle in The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/race-europe-london-istanbul-public-transport-b2391611.html). I immediately searched for the event online and signed up for the second edition, which would cover the 1,175 mi / 1,892 km from London to Tirana.

## The Checkpoint Reveal
My wife patiently sits with me, waiting for the race to start. I'm quite nervous. While other racers start pouring in and meeting each other, I just sit silently, contemplating the red envelope containing the race pack, which we are strictly prohibited from opening until the race kicks off. Inside, of course, are the locations of the intermediate checkpoints.

Five minutes before the start, Race Director James Finnerty takes the stage. This year's race theme is film, and the story behind the route is that a certain famous Austrian bodybuilder-turned-movie-star has lost the script for his latest movie, _The Albanian Connection_. At the first checkpoint in Bruges, each of the 180 participants will need to pick up one line from the script (we knew about this location beforehand; otherwise, getting a seat on the Eurostar would have been impossible).

Next, we’ll need to do some location scouting at the second checkpoint, where we can choose between:
* The Contra Dam in Switzerland, where 007 performs an impressive bungee jump stunt in the opening of _GoldenEye_.
* The Plönlein in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany, featured in _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_.
* The iconic Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin, seen in _Run Lola Run_.

After that, all racers must pass through the Austrian city of Graz and deliver their script line at the Palais-Hotel Erzherzog Johann, right in the city centre.

From there, we are allowed to choose once again between two possible checkpoints:
* The Grand Hotel in Rimini, on the Adriatic Coast of Italy.
* Union Square in Timișoara, Romania.

We’ll then end the race in Tirana, the Albanian capital, at a space just next to Skanderbeg Square, the main plaza in the centre of the city.

I realise that this year's checkpoints are in indirect locations, most of them requiring noticeable detours from the shortest route to Tirana. That should be fun. I don’t have much time to think about the checkpoints now (_Rothenburg-ob-der-what? Where in Romania is Timișoara?_), as the race starts and we need to GO, GO, GO!

## London - Bruges
It's 11:45, and I start running among other racers towards the Leicester Square Tube station. I have a seat booked on the next Eurostar train to Brussels, scheduled to depart at 13:01. I have plenty of time to get to St Pancras, as the ticket gates only close 30 minutes before departure (in practice, it's often later than that, but don’t use that advice and then blame me if you miss your train). I still run, however, for two reasons: 1) I’ve been building up adrenaline while waiting for the race to start, and 2) the sooner I can sit down and start planning my route, the better.

I don't have to wait long for a Piccadilly Line train, and thanks to the rollout of 5G in the Underground tunnels, I can start planning my route. The first leg is already planned and quite easy: ride on the aforementioned Eurostar to Brussels Midi, and from there, make a 14-minute connection to a Belgian Intercity train to Bruges. I know I’ll need to push my way out of the Eurostar platform in Brussels, as the only way out is a couple of lifts and a small staircase, but I think I should be able to make it if there aren't any delays on the Eurostar.

If all goes to plan, I should reach the checkpoint in the centre of Bruges by 18:00. I’ve even already bought a local bus ticket from the station to the city centre.

Of all the possible choices for the second checkpoint, my favourite is the Contra Dam, as I vaguely remember it from the film and I'm sure it must be quite spectacular. It is also close on the map to Graz, and the Swiss route is much more reliable than others since the trains there run on time, which definitely can’t be said about Germany. Of course, I promptly confirm my suspicions: the dam is in too remote a location to make it a viable option if I want to try winning the race.

Berlin is quite far away but offers excellent connections, including night trains. The more scenic route via Rothenburg is more direct but requires more connections.

There’s not much time to keep researching, though: the train arrives at King's Cross St. Pancras, and it’s time to get out of the Tube. It brings back memories of morning rush-hour commutes, switching from the Victoria to the Northern Line among hundreds of people through the tunnel maze. Even though it's Saturday, it's no different this time, but I manage to push my way through, climbing on the left side of the escalators, silently cursing the tourists on their way to Platform 9 3/4 who don’t seem to be aware of the dozen signs telling them to stand on the right. Still, when I check the time, it’s 12:02. Fantastic.

It doesn’t take long to pass through security, and thanks to my Spanish passport, I’m able to skip the line for non-EU citizens at French immigration controls. I skim through the dozens of people in line to board the train to Paris, buy a bottle of water (not carrying one from home is my second costly mistake), and find a seat where I can take out my laptop and plan the itinerary in earnest. Surprisingly, the station WiFi is working just fine, albeit a bit slow, as you would expect. In these crowds, phone data just doesn't work, so I have to be patient.

You may be surprised that I’m carrying a laptop in a race, where packing light is essential, but I think it has helped me greatly. I'm still only travelling with a small backpack, but there's so much more I’m able to get done with a big screen and a keyboard as opposed to just a phone.

By the time boarding for my train opens, I have the first part of my plan: I’m going to go via Rothenburg. It’ll involve a night bus from Belgium to Germany and a lot of trains within Germany, which isn’t ideal, but I prefer this route to the Berlin option. Rothenburg looks lovely, and I’ve never been there before. The multiple connections and shorter total distance are a plus, too.

As soon as I find my seat on the Eurostar, I plug in my phone charger: I can’t afford not to charge my phone, battery pack, laptop, or earbuds (in that order of priority) whenever I get the chance. A couple of minutes later, the fellow sitting next to me arrives, and as he makes his way to his window seat, he immediately destroys my USB adaptor with one of his legs. Thank God I carry a spare.

The bad news onboard the train is that there is no phone reception whatsoever, and the train WiFi isn’t working at all for me. I just wait anxiously for the train to depart, hoping to get some signal once we’re out of the station, watching the clock and pointlessly trying to refresh pages in the meantime.

I sigh in relief when the train departs on time, and during the journey, I manage to plan most of my route to Tirana, switching between the train WiFi and my phone’s data, refreshing everything a dozen times until it works. I even miraculously manage to pay for a night bus ticket from inside the Channel Tunnel. All of this while my seat companion, an American visiting Europe for the first time, keeps asking questions about trains, borders, and such, and remarking how cool it’d be to drive his car (which I can only imagine to be some sort of [massive pick up truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nZh7A7qTPo)) as fast as the the train goes.

At 16:38, we arrive at Brussels Midi, and I jump off the train, trying to overtake as many people as possible. My memories of the station were right, and there’s a massive chokepoint exiting the Eurostar area, but I manage to get to the platform for my train to Bruges, which departs at 16:52.

Once aboard, I start to panic slightly as the departure time passes and the train stands still on the platform. Only five minutes later, however, the train leaves, and I realise I don't really have much cause for concern: I have slightly over an hour in Bruges, and the station is reasonably close to the town's main square, where the checkpoint is located.

  
It’s time to polish the final details of my route. I’ve decided to take the Italian route, passing through the checkpoint in Rimini and heading to Albania via a ferry from Bari. The overland route via Timișoara looks very interesting, but there doesn’t seem to be a reliable route to cross from Timișoara to Serbia, involving different buses and a shuttle across the border. As much as I try (and I will try a few times over the next day), I can’t find a route through the Balkans that is faster than the ferry. Which isn’t ideal, as I realise I can comfortably reach Bari by Monday afternoon, but what seems to be the only ferry departing that day doesn’t leave until 23:00. The hour-long journey passes quickly, though, and I'm still thinking about that when I realise we're about to reach Bruges.

Getting off the train, I realise that I'm at the other end of the platform from the exit, and I am glad to have a lengthy connection in Bruges. I don't dawdle anyway, and run off the station in searching for the bus stop, where I'm quite lucky to catch a bus in less than a couple of minutes. After a sprint through the pedestrianised streets in the city centre, where I kinda feel like in a spy movie, passing through the hordes of tourist, I reach the checkpoint at 18:05. I take a minute though, to find Bob, the rep from Lupine travel waiting there, as I was expecting him to wear one of the race's bright red t-shirts. I get the script line safely copied into my notes app and make my way back to the train station.

With the checkpoint cleared, and having almost an hour before my next train, I decide to walk back to the station and enjoy the city. I have been in Bruges before, but I'm still captivated by it's fairytale beauty and take my mind off the race while taking in the sights for the next half of an hour.
