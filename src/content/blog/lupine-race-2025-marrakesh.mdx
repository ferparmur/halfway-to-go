It's 9:44 on a sunny Sunday morning in May in Lyon, France. I'm basking in the sun after having an excellent
croissant for breakfast, when I suddenly receive a text on my phone that makes me curse audibly in public: the train
I was waiting to catch in less than half hour has been delayed by 20 minutes. Without figuring out all the details,
I immediately know that that is going to destroy all the work that I've been doing for the past 24 hours.

How did I end up in this position? Well, after participating in last year's [Lupine Race to Albania](/lupine-race-2024/)
and having so much fun, I signed up as soon as possible to the following edition, which was called "The Marrakesh
Express", and would cover the 2,300 km between London and Marrakesh from 17th to 24th May, 2025.

I was really excited about this edition of the race, as it would pass through my native region of Andalusia in
Southern Spain, and Marrakesh is one of my all-time favourite destinations, having been there multiple times.

In case you don't know, the [Lupine Race](https://lupine.co.uk/race/) is a public transport race, organised by the folks
at [Lupine Travel](https://lupinetravel.co.uk/). Trains, buses, and ferries are allowed, but taxis are only
permissible within city limits, and you can't catch an airplane, helicopter or hot-air balloon. Whilst you know the
start and end locations, there are a series of checkpoints that you need to clear along the way. The location of
these is only revealed at the start of the race, so you can't plan in advance. The exception is the first stop in
continental Europe, which is always announced beforehand, as getting a last-minute train over the English Channel
would be otherwise prohibitively expensive or outright impossible. For this race, we know that the first checkpoint
is going to be situated in Paris.

So this adventure starts with me heading to the Herne Hill Velodrome in South London, in the company, once again, of my
ever supportive wife, Cris. We arrive to Brixton station, on the Victoria Line, which is not the closest station to
the Velodrome, but is the nearest one within the area of coverage of the TfL cycle hire scheme, aka Boris bikes.

You see, in previous editions the race started from Trafalgar Square, which made it trivial to get to St Pancras
station where the Eurostar departs: a quick hop on the Piccadilly line of the Tube and you arrive there in less than
20 minutes without breaking a sweat. This time, however, the start has moved to the aforementioned Herne Hill
Velodrome, an iconic venue that hosted the cycling events of the 1948 London Olympics.

The first challenge us racers are facing is getting from there across London to St. Pancras to catch the Eurostar.
The race starts at 10:30 sharp, and the first train to Paris departs at 11:31. A lot of participants will probably
have decided to take the following train at 12:31, but when competing for the fastest arrival, a difference of one
hour could be irrelevant, or could cascade and compound into an ever bigger delay.

Getting on that first train is going to be tough, and the most straightforward option is getting a Thameslink train
direct to St. Pancras at 10:42 from the nearby Herne Hill Station. There are two problems with that option, though:
first, the station is 1.3 km away from the start line, so getting there quickly enough to catch that train would
mean having to run a little bit, and I know from the last race that the opportunities to get a shower during the
event are quite slim, so sweating that early into it is not appealing at all. Second, British trains can be
unreliable at the best of times, and I definitely don't want to get stuck there and miss the Eurostar.

With all of that in mind, I came up with a different plan: getting an electric bike from the closest docking station,
carrying it to the Velodrome with me, and using it to get back to Brixton. One the one hand, that means not having
internet access for the half an hour or so that it will take me to get there. On the other, Victoria line trains are
fast and frequent, and I could even get to the Eurostar boarding area a couple of minutes earlier than taking the
Thameslink train.

We arrive, bike in hand, to the velodrome a little bit after the advertised opening time of 9:00 AM. I go to
check-in and get my race pack (which we are strictly prohibited to open before the race starts), GPS tracker, and swag;
and say hello to the organising team and other racers that I met during last year's edition. It's soon time to line
up in the starting line and listen to the checkpoint reveal.

## The Checkpoints
Over the speaker, Race Director James Finnerty introduces the event and announces the checkpoints we will need to
hit. The first one we already knew:

- **Paris**, where racers will have to clear two checkpoints, depending on which route they'll choose.

Then comes a surprise: while in previous editions of the race checkpoints were independent of each other, and
competitors were able to choose freely whenever there was more than one option, for the first half of the race we're
forced to choose among three fixed routes:

- **The Pilgrim's Picnic**, which emulates the Camino de Santiago and passes through:
  - **Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port**, just north of the Pyrenees in the French Basque Country.
  - **Santiago de Compostela**, the destination of the Camino

- **The Mountain Goat**, an alpine itinerary with stops in:
  - **Chamonix**, the base for the ascent of the Mont Blanc
  - **Andorra La Vella**, the capital of the microstate in the middle of the Pyrenees

- **The Island Hopper**, a ferry-heavy option including:
  - **Toulon**, in the Côte d'Azur
  - **Palma de Mallorca**, the capital of the Balearic Islands.

From there, all routes converge into a single itinerary:
- **Valencia**, in the eastern coast of Spain
- **Tangiers**, the Moroccan port where we'll enter Africa
- **Marrakesh**, where racers must clear a final checkpoint before heading to the finish line

<Figure img="lupine-race-2025-marrakesh-map.jpg" caption="The route options" alt="Map depicting the route options for
the race" />

I don't really register all the options, but decide against opening the race pack right now, as it'll be a hassle to
get it out and back again into my backpack in the minute or so before the race starts. I'll have time to check it on
my way to the Eurostar.

## Leg 1: London to Paris
The race starts as soon as the clock hits 10:30. I navigate through the crowd with my bike and get on it as soon as
possible, easily overtaking everyone else. I'm in the lead!! The bike ride goes smoothly and I manage to get to a
Victoria line train in Brixton in just over 11 minutes.

The downside of this strategy is that the Victoria line doesn't have mobile coverage yet, so for the 20 minutes I'm
riding the tube I won't be able to check itinerary options. What I can do is open the race pack and start locating
where the checkpoints are on the map.

With the help of the European Rail Atlas, I locate the most obscure ones, Chamonix and Saintt-Jean-Pied-de-Port, and see
that both are in the French railway network, and relatively close to major cities: Geneva and Bayonne, respectively.
At this point, of course, I don't need to worry to much about the second half of the race, as all routes converge in
Valencia.

I look at the options with the routes traced on the map, and I think I'm going to take The Pilgrim's Picnic. Getting
in and out of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port looks easy enough, being so close to Bayonne. I know that the awful
radial design of the Spanish railway network means that the fastest way to get to Santiago is probably going south,
possibly all the way to Madrid, to go back up north, and then backtrack to head to Valencia. However, there should
be plenty of connections available and a lot of them would involve high-speed trains.

The problem with the Mountain Goat route, which is the most direct one, is Andorra, as getting to Chamonix, which is a
major mountain resort town, and really close to Turin and Geneva, shouldn't be too hard. But I already know that the
only way of getting to Andorra is by bus, either from Toulouse or Barcelona, or from a nearby train station that is
infrequently served by night trains from Paris.

I don't really think much of the Island Hopper route. The Interrail map shows that the ferry to Palma from Barcelona
takes six and half hours, while the ferry from Palma to Valencia takes nine. Surely the other two routes offer
faster options to get to Valencia.

While I'm still considering this, the train arrives to King's Cross St. Pancras and it's time to overtake the
tourists heading for Platform 9¾. I arrive to the Eurostar check-in 27 minutes after departing from Herne Hill,
which is a personal record. I breeze through security and passport control, and realise that my train isn't even
boarding yet.

Since I had booked a first class seat at great expense, as it allows to check in just 15 minutes before the train
departs, instead of the usual 30, I decide to make the most of it and access the first class lounge, where I'll also
have better Wi-Fi.

I grab a Coke Zero and start checking the itineraries. It seems that the journey through Santiago is actually quite
slow, as it looks like I won't be able to make it to Valencia until at least Monday at 11:30 AM. The reason for that is
that there don't seem to be any overnight connections out of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, which means that I would be
able to get there tonight, but would have to wait until past 9:30 AM on Sunday to get back to Bayonne.

I start looking at the Mountain Goat route next. There is a TGV from Paris Gare de Lyon to Geneva at 16:10 that looks
quite attractive, as I'll arrive in Paris at 14:53, so I should be able to board it just after clearing the two
checkpoints in the French capital. It also means that anyone that is taking the next Eurostar to avoid the rush to
St. Pancras won't be able to get it. Furthermore, that TGV arrives to Geneva at 19:29, and I can take a bus to
Chamonix from there at 20:05, arriving at 22:00, which is quite fast considering how remote Chamonix is.

The problem, I know, is going to be getting from the Alps to the Pyrenees and into Andorra, but before I can check
how much of problem that is going to be, I hear the boarding call for my train. Not wanting to miss it, I finish my
drink quickly and go join the boarding queue. On the way out of the lounge, I spot fellow racer Sam S. I'm tempted
to say hi, but she looks really focused on her screen, so I decide against it. I'm not totally happy to ser either:
I knew some more people were going to be able to catch the first Eurostar, but a boy can hope...

Anyway, I make my way to the far end of St. Pancras –I've booked the first seat of the train, looking to get into
Paris without anyone or anyone's luggage holding me back, and board.

At least this year I get mobile reception on the train, which wasn't the case last year, although coverage is patchy
at best while still in England, improving once we're in the channel and working perfectly fine once in France. In
any case, I get back to looking at my itinerary options. I was right in thinking that getting through Andorra was
going to be a pain, and from first glance it seems that the fastest I could do it is going first to Barcelona and
then back up the Pyrenees again. However, this itinerary seems to place me in Valencia at 4:42 AM on Monday morning,
which is not bad at all.

I then look at the Island Hopper route quite sceptically. I don't like to depend on ferries, as their schedules can
be capricious to say the least. A quick glance puts the arrival time into Palma de Mallorca at 6:00 on Monday
morning, and I stop looking there. Now, if instead of letting me get carried away by a severe case of confirmation
bias, I'd have spent a few minutes looking deeply into the route, I could have noticed that there was a much faster
route: going quickly from Touloun to Barcelona, taking the ferry from Barcelona to the northern port of Mallorca,
Alcudia, and then crossing the island before hopping in an overnight ferry from Palma to Valencia. That itinerary
would put you in Valencia at 8:00 AM on Monday, and depending on much less tight connections than the Mountain Goat
option, which from my calculations hinged on a 5-minute connection in Narbonne.

I would of course not realize that the fastest route through Palma existed until it was too late, with terrible
consequences as you might be anticipating. Looking back, however, I think I would still have taken the high-risk,
high-reward option of going through Chamonix and Andorra.

Time flies, though, and I need to commit to my plan: clear the Paris checkpoints, and take the train to Geneva.
Since this race was going to happen through Spain, where the Interrail pass is largely useless, and Morocco, which
is not covered at all by it, I have decided not to purchase one, so I'll need to pay full price on tickets. The
last-minute ticket price for the international TGV to Geneva is so high, over €180, that it's actually cheaper to
buy the SNCF Advantage discount card, which costs €50. Since it's also only over €5 to upgrade to first class, I
think that I might as well do that.

Now I need to sort out my tickets for the Paris metro. I've heard that RATP, the Île-de-France public transport
agency, are finally getting rid of paper tickets. Only nw, as the train inches closer and closer to Paris, do I
realize that I have failed to plan for this properly: getting the info on how to pay for the Paris metro is
something that I should have cleared well before the start of the race, as I'm now figured to waste precious time
figuring it out.

Turns out that instead of doing the sensible thing and allow contactless cards to be used to pay at the turnstiles,
you have to buy tickets on your phone via the Bonjour RATP app. I install the app, sign up, and try to buy tickets
before discovering that to do that you need to install a second app that just runs the background process to hold
and activate the tickets. After spending who knows how much time setting up the bloody thing, running device
compatibility checks, and reciting the Marseillaise in reverse three times, I finally manage to purchase three single
tickets and get on with my day. By now, though, Paris is getting really close.

## Leg 2: Paris to Chamonix

The Eurostar actually pulls into Gare du Nord 5 minutes early, at 14:48, and as planned I'm the first of the
passengers to step into the station. I'm familiar enough with its layout to go straight to the Metro station, and
I'm already waiting for a Line 4 train at 14:51.

The rush is justified. Before leaving the French capital, we need to clear two checkpoints:

-   The first one is common to all racers, and we can choose between **Ladurée** in Rue Royale near the Madeleine
    church, or **VG Pâtisserie**, a vegan shop on Boulevard Voltaire.

-   The second one depends on which of the three itineraries you've chosen. For The Mountain Goat route through
    Chamonix and Andorra, we're required to go up **Montmartre** as to get acquainted with heights, and take a photo
    of **Le Passe-Muraille**, a sculpture of a man passing through a wall.

Now, nowhere on the race pack says that we need to hit them in that order, just that we need to clear both
checkpoints before getting out of Paris. If I had realized that , I could have gone to Montmartre first, then to
Lauduree, and then to Gare de Lyon, doing a counter-clockwise tour through the Rive Droîte.

<Figure img="paris-checkpoints-nice-order.jpg" caption="What I could have done..." alt="Map of Paris showing a straightforward
itinerary from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon, passing first trough Montmartre and then trhough Madeleine" />

Instead, I assumed that I had to go to Ladurée first. That means that I have to south from the Gare du Nord down to
the patîsserie, then go back up north to Montmartre, before tracing a long diagonal to the southeast to get to Gare
de Lyon. I should still be able to make it, but I'm going to need to run

<Figure img="paris-checkpoints-actual-order.jpg" caption="...what I actually did" alt="Map of Paris showing a convoluted
itinerary from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon, passing first trough Madeleine and then trhough Montmartre" />

After riding the Line 4 for four stops, I change at Strasbourg Saint-Denis, and while waiting for the Line 8 train
to arrive I spot Sam S. again and we wave at each other. After waiting for the train for five excruciating minutes,
I don't spot any other racers there. Since I think that we need to hit the checkpoints in order, and Ladurée made
way more sense than VG Pâtisserie for any of the three routes (that's the first think I checked back in St. Pancras),
I wonder for a moment if this race's competition isn't going to be so fierce as the previous one, before realizing
that there's no way that is going to be the case.

At 15:11, with just 59 minutes to the departure of my next train, I clear the Ladurée checkpoint. I consider
actually buying macarrons for a millisecond before processing how stupid of an idea that would be. Sam S. was there
with me, and when I look back at her after a couple of seconds she's meters ahead on the way to the Concorde metro
station. That's a wake-up call and I decide to give her a run for her money and sprint ahead like a mad man. We both
laugh as we both audibly laugh. That's what great about the Lupine Race: the competition is absolutely real and
fierce, but everyone takes it in good spirits.

I arrive into Place Concorde trying to find the entrance to the metro station. I wait to cross the street and in
that time Sam S. catches up with me. I was engrossed looking at the map trying to see the entrance, and she takes
the lead crossing the road. I start running again, but look back on the left and spot a stone balustrade –that must
be an entrance, and, in fact it, is. I devilishly laugh at leaving Sam. S fending by herself, not knowing that she's
going to take an entirely different route and I won't see her again until a few days later.

I take the Line 12 train direct to Lamarck Caulaincourt, the closest station to the Passe-Muraille sculpture. On the
way there, I purchase my bus ticket from Geneva to Chamonix. Being under the hill of Montmartre, the station is deep,
25 m underground, and has no escalators, only a lift and a spiral staircase. I'm quite lucky though, as I managed to
catch a lift about to depart while I was already looking for the stairs.

Once on the ground, I make a mistake and go down the steep staircase in front of the station. Fortunately, it only
takes a few meters to realize my mistake and turn back. Already strapped for time, I run uphill dodging tourists and
dash through Montmarte approaching the checkpoint. On the crossroads next to the sculpture, I have a couple seconds
of doubt. There's another team of racers there and when they see me looking around at back at my phone, slightly
confused, one of them signs to me to go back on my tracks.

The fact that I'm trying to puzzle out how another team could beat me to Montmartre by so much probably doesn't help
with my confused expression as, once again, I didn't realize you could go there first before visiting one of the
pâtisseries.

I don't think the way they're pointing is right, but I don't think twice about it and follow their indication. A few
metres later I realized that there is no way the checkpoint is that way, and I turn back again and head to the
crossroads, having figured out that the monument is just to the left of it.

I see the people in the other team laughing and pointing in the right direction now. I'm flabbergasted at what just
happened. That goes directly against the rules of the race, although I choose not to say anything because I think it
wasn't done in bad faith, and it didn't cause me too much trouble, although it could, as I need to go to the other
side of Paris to catch a train that leaves in 36 minutes and hast costed me a small fortune, and missing one metro
train can lead to me missing it. I think they're probably first-timers that don't fully comprehend how
devastating the implications of those shenanigans could be, and have other things to worry about at the moment.

Being completely honest, thinking back about it as I write this lines, I'm getting belated anger, as now I can fully
realize the potential ramifications of those shenanigans. If something like that happens in the future, I won't let
it slide.

Anyway, I quickly go in front of the Passe-Muraille sculpture and take the customary selfie at 15:34, before sprinting
back to the same Metro station I came from. I'm really lucky and I a train arrives almost as soon as I get onto the
platform, after breezing down the spiral staircase. The Line 12 train seems to take forever to go back to Madeleine,
where I change to the modern Line 14, taking me all the way to Gare de Lyon where I finally arrive at 15:57.

I make it all the way to my train with 8 minutes to spare. It's curious how your mindset changes when doing this
race. I'm normally the kind of person that wastes too much time at airports, because I can't bring myself to arrive
less than 2 hours before a flight. Now I'm getting to a train station less than 10 minutes before departure, and it
feels like plenty.

Anyway, I find my way to my seat, which I'm glad to have booked on the upper deck. Not that there were many seats
available, though: I had to get a seat in a table of four, which is hell when you're travelling solo, as you're
forced to face a stranger and make sure to not invade their personal space accidentally.

I try to connect to the train Wi-Fi, which of course doesn't work, but thankfully I manage to get consistenly good
reception for almost the whole trip. Time to polish my plan.

At this point, I'm fully commited to this route now, there's no way to turn back and choose any of the other
options. I'm still quite confident I've made the right choice, though.

The first thing I need to do is figure out what the Chamonix checkpoint is. Last year, the checkpoint locations
where specified in the Race Pack down to the exact coordinates (well, what3words location). This time around,
they're hidden behind easy-to-solve riddles. We're told to take a picture of the two separate statues that honor the
first climbers of the Mont Blanc.

Upon some lightweight research on Wikipedia, I learn that these are Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard.
Balmat's statue is very easy to locate, but Paccard's, which turns out to be just 50 metres away, doesn't have a
photo of its own on the Google Maps entry. A quick inspection with streetview and a couple of external sources
confirm the location, though.

Once the spots are marked on the map, it's time to start refining my route. So far, my itinerary puts me in Andorra
at 20:00 tomorrow, which is good enough to get me to Valencia at 4:30 AM on Monday morning. That's quite important,
as I'm aiming to take the first connection out of Valencia, at 6:57 AM. As long as I can make that, I'm looking at a
speedy arrival to Marrakesh on late Monday evening or just past midnight.

The problem is that on Sunday, I'll have to make a few tight connections to get to Barcelona, from where I'll
backtrack to Andorra, before heading back to Barcelona and then overnight to Andorra. That's quite a circuitous route.

I look at the buses in and out of Andorra. From Toulouse, there are only two buses I could take: one at 13:45,
that will put me in Andorra at 18:20 and be a massive win, and another one at 17:45. The latest is more of a backup
plan than anything: it's scheduled to arrive to Andorra La Vella at 22:20, which would derail all of my onward
itinerary.

There are a lot of services departing from Barcelona, and that's why my original itinerary goes there. But as I
mentioned above, that hinges on quite a few tight connections. It would look like this:

1.  Getting to Lyon before 10:00 AM. That part is easy as there are a couple of options that I could take that would
    give me plenty of time to spare.

2.  Taking the 10:10 AM TGV to Toulouse and getting off in Narbonne, where I'd have a 5-minute connection to a
    regional train to Perpignan. This doesn't make me too nervous, as the TGV is supposed to be the most dependable
    service to cross france, and the SNCF actually sells the connection as a single ticket.

3.   Arriving to Perpignan at 13:48, and from there take either the 14:00 BlaBlaCar Bus or the 14:05 Flixbus coaches
    to Barcelona, arriving to the North Bus station of the Catalan capital at around 16:30. The former departs from
    Marseille at 9:00, stopping in Nîmes, Montpellier, Perpignan, and Girona; while the latter departs from Lyon at
    7:30, making the same intermediate stops except Girona, meaning that it runs direct from Perpignan to Barcelona.
    While this would be my preferred option, I know that bus timetables are unreliable to say the least, specially
    in a case like this when they have been running for hours before the stop where I would board. As long as any of
    the two are remotely within schedule, though, I should be fine.

4.  Crossing Barcelona in less than 45 minutes to take the bus to Andorra at 17:15 from the Zona Universitària metro
    stop. This is quite a short time window, and that's why relying on buses to get to Barcelona makes me a bit uneasy.

Getting that bus to Andorra is quite important, as it would leave me there at 20:00, although in practice it would
probably arrive earlier, since from what I can see the timetables have a lot of built-in room for slack. Once in
Andorra La Vella, clearing the checkpoint should be a breeze, as the required proof is getting a picture of the
Andorran coat of arms, which I reckon should be quite easy, specially knowing that is featured in the national flag.

The important bit is that I need to catch the 20:15 bus from Andorra to Barcelona. That would put me back there at
23:15, which leaves me enough time to catch the 23:59 or 01:00 overnight buses to Valencia. After that, the next
departure from Andorra to Barcelona isn't until 22:15, arriving too late to catch any of those overnight buses, and
making me wait until the 7:10 train, which would be catastrophic.

After careful research, I fully understand all the nitty-gritty of the itinerary, but I'm hopeful. It doesn't seem
too far of a stretch to think that I should be able to get to Toulouse in time for that 13:45 bus to Andorra,
considering that I'll arrive in Chamonaix at 22:00. I start to try to find a way to do that, when I look out of the
window and realize that we must be getting close to Switzerland, as the scenery has changed quite a bit, from the
cultivated flats and rolling hills of the typical French countryside, to a more alpine landscape. The sights are
beautiful, and I try to take a mental break from all the planning and concentrate on the landscape for a bit, but
fail. Soon enough, the train starts crossing a succession of tunnels, which leaves my phone without reception and
forces said mental break on me.

]}/>

Before I have time to process everything, the train approaches Geneva on time. I've taken a look at it and since the
coach station is next to the lake, and I have over 30 minutes to change, I can go the waterside and see the lake and
the infamous water jet. I'm looking forward to that, as I've never been here before and the weather is extraordinary.
