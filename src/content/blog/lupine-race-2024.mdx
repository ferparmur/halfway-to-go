It’s 10:30 AM on a sunny summer morning when my wife and I arrive at the courtyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, just next to Trafalgar Square in London. We're early, having gotten off the Tube one stop early at Embankment, which gave us the chance to buy an expensive coffee along the way. Once we arrive, I'm reminded that my entry fee covered refreshments, including coffee, for free. Oh well, the race hasn't even started, and I'm already making costly mistakes.

We're waiting here until 11:45, when the 2024 edition of the Lupine Race begins. What’s the [Lupine Race](https://www.lupine.co.uk/race/), you might ask? In a nutshell, it’s a race across Europe using only overland public transport. No airplanes, no cars —just good ol' trains, buses, and ferries. To prevent participants from planning their route in advance, the race requires them to pass through several intermediate checkpoints, which are only revealed when the race begins.

The first edition of the race took place in 2023, going from London to Istanbul. Unfortunately, I only learned about it after it had happened through [Simon Calder's chronicle in The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/race-europe-london-istanbul-public-transport-b2391611.html). I immediately searched for the event online and signed up for the second edition, which would cover the 1,175 mi / 1,892 km from London to Tirana.

## The Checkpoint Reveal
My wife patiently sits with me, waiting for the race to start. I'm quite nervous. While other racers start pouring in and meeting each other, I just sit silently, contemplating the red envelope containing the race pack, which we are strictly prohibited from opening until the race kicks off. Inside, of course, are the locations of the intermediate checkpoints.

Five minutes before the start, Race Director James Finnerty takes the stage. This year's race theme is film, and the story behind the route is that a certain famous Austrian bodybuilder-turned-movie-star has lost the script for his latest movie, _The Albanian Connection_. At the first checkpoint in Bruges, each of the 180 participants will need to pick up one line from the script (we knew about this location beforehand; otherwise, getting a seat on the Eurostar would have been impossible).

Next, we’ll need to do some location scouting at the second checkpoint, where we can choose between:
* The Contra Dam in Switzerland, where 007 performs an impressive bungee jump stunt in the opening of _GoldenEye_.
* The Plönlein in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany, featured in _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_.
* The iconic Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin, seen in _Run Lola Run_.

After that, all racers must pass through the Austrian city of Graz and deliver their script line at the Palais-Hotel Erzherzog Johann, right in the city centre.

From there, we are allowed to choose once again between two possible checkpoints:
* The Grand Hotel in Rimini, on the Adriatic Coast of Italy.
* Union Square in Timișoara, Romania.

We’ll then end the race in Tirana, the Albanian capital, at a space just next to Skanderbeg Square, the main plaza in the centre of the city.

I realise that this year's checkpoints are in indirect locations, most of them requiring noticeable detours from the shortest route to Tirana. That should be fun. I don’t have much time to think about the checkpoints now (_Rothenburg-ob-der-what? Where in Romania is Timișoara?_), as the race starts and we need to GO, GO, GO!

## Leg 1: London - Bruges
It's 11:45, and I start running among other racers towards the Leicester Square Tube station. I have a seat booked on the next Eurostar train to Brussels, scheduled to depart at 13:01. I have plenty of time to get to St Pancras, as the ticket gates only close 30 minutes before departure (in practice, it's often later than that, but don’t use that advice and then blame me if you miss your train). I still run, however, for two reasons: 1) I’ve been building up adrenaline while waiting for the race to start, and 2) the sooner I can sit down and start planning my route, the better.

I don't have to wait long for a Piccadilly Line train, and thanks to the rollout of 5G in the Underground tunnels, I can start planning my route. The first leg is already planned and quite easy: ride on the aforementioned Eurostar to Brussels Midi, and from there, make a 14-minute connection to a Belgian Intercity train to Bruges. I know I’ll need to push my way out of the Eurostar platform in Brussels, as the only way out is a couple of lifts and a small staircase, but I think I should be able to make it if there aren't any delays on the Eurostar.

If all goes to plan, I should reach the checkpoint in the centre of Bruges by 18:00. I’ve even already bought a local bus ticket from the station to the city centre.

Of all the possible choices for the second checkpoint, my favourite is the Contra Dam, as I vaguely remember it from the film and I'm sure it must be quite spectacular. It is also close on the map to Graz, and the Swiss route is much more reliable than others since the trains there run on time, which definitely can’t be said about Germany. Of course, I promptly confirm my suspicions: the dam is in too remote a location to make it a viable option if I want to try winning the race.

Berlin is quite far away but offers excellent connections, including night trains. The more scenic route via Rothenburg is more direct but requires more connections.

There’s not much time to keep researching, though: the train arrives at King's Cross St. Pancras, and it’s time to get out of the Tube. It brings back memories of morning rush-hour commutes, switching from the Victoria to the Northern Line among hundreds of people through the tunnel maze. Even though it's Saturday, it's no different this time, but I manage to push my way through, climbing on the left side of the escalators, silently cursing the tourists on their way to Platform 9 3/4 who don’t seem to be aware of the dozen signs telling them to stand on the right. Still, when I check the time, it’s 12:02. Fantastic.

It doesn’t take long to pass through security, and thanks to my Spanish passport, I’m able to skip the line for non-EU citizens at French immigration controls. I skim through the dozens of people in line to board the train to Paris, buy a bottle of water (not carrying one from home is my second costly mistake), and find a seat where I can take out my laptop and plan the itinerary in earnest. Surprisingly, the station WiFi is working just fine, albeit a bit slow, as you would expect. In these crowds, phone data just doesn't work, so I have to be patient.

You may be surprised that I’m carrying a laptop in a race, where packing light is essential, but I think it has helped me greatly. I'm still only travelling with a small backpack, but there's so much more I’m able to get done with a big screen and a keyboard as opposed to just a phone.

By the time boarding for my train opens, I have the first part of my plan: I’m going to go via Rothenburg. It’ll involve a night bus from Belgium to Germany and a lot of trains within Germany, which isn’t ideal, but I prefer this route to the Berlin option. Rothenburg looks lovely, and I’ve never been there before. The multiple connections and shorter total distance are a plus, too.

As soon as I find my seat on the Eurostar, I plug in my phone charger: I can’t afford not to charge my phone, battery pack, laptop, or earbuds (in that order of priority) whenever I get the chance. A couple of minutes later, the fellow sitting next to me arrives, and as he makes his way to his window seat, he immediately destroys my USB adaptor with one of his legs. Thank God I carry a spare.

The bad news onboard the train is that there is no phone reception whatsoever, and the train WiFi isn’t working at all for me. I just wait anxiously for the train to depart, hoping to get some signal once we’re out of the station, watching the clock and pointlessly trying to refresh pages in the meantime.

I sigh in relief when the train departs on time, and during the journey, I manage to plan most of my route to Tirana, switching between the train WiFi and my phone’s data, refreshing everything a dozen times until it works. I even miraculously manage to pay for a night bus ticket from inside the Channel Tunnel. All of this while my seat companion, an American visiting Europe for the first time, keeps asking questions about trains, borders, and such, and remarking how cool it’d be to drive his car (which I can only imagine to be some sort of [massive pick up truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nZh7A7qTPo)) as fast as the the train goes.

At 16:38, we arrive at Brussels Midi, and I jump off the train, trying to overtake as many people as possible. My memories of the station were right, and there’s a massive chokepoint exiting the Eurostar area, but I manage to get to the platform for my train to Bruges, which departs at 16:52.

Once aboard, I start to panic slightly as the departure time passes and the train stands still on the platform. Only five minutes later, however, the train leaves, and I realise I don't really have much cause for concern: I have slightly over an hour in Bruges, and the station is reasonably close to the town's main square, where the checkpoint is located.

It’s time to polish the final details of my route. I’ve decided to take the Italian route, passing through the checkpoint in Rimini and heading to Albania via a ferry from Bari. The overland route via Timișoara looks very interesting, but there doesn’t seem to be a reliable route to cross from Timișoara to Serbia, involving different buses and a shuttle across the border. As much as I try (and I will try a few times over the next day), I can’t find a route through the Balkans that is faster than the ferry. Which isn’t ideal, as I realise I can comfortably reach Bari by Monday afternoon, but what seems to be the only ferry departing that day doesn’t leave until 23:00. The hour-long journey passes quickly, though, and I'm still thinking about that when I realise we're about to reach Bruges.

Getting off the train, I realise that I'm at the other end of the platform from the exit, and I am glad to have a lengthy connection in Bruges. I don't dawdle anyway, and run off the station in searching for the bus stop, where I'm quite lucky to catch a bus in less than a couple of minutes. After a sprint through the pedestrianised streets in the city centre, where I kinda feel like in a spy movie, passing through the hordes of tourist, I reach the checkpoint at 18:05. I take a minute though, to find Bob, the rep from Lupine travel waiting there, as I was expecting him to wear one of the race's bright red t-shirts. I get the script line safely copied into my notes app and make my way back to the train station.

<Figure img="bruges-selfie.jpg" caption="Victory selfie after completing the checkpoint in the Grand-Place of Bruges (and a street lamp coming out of my head)" />

With the checkpoint cleared, and having almost an hour before my next train, I decide to walk back to the station and enjoy the city. I have been in Bruges before, but I'm still captivated by it's fairytale beauty and take my mind off the race while taking in the sights for the next half of an hour.

## Leg 2: Bruges - Rothenburg ob der Tauber
While waiting for my train to Eastern Belgium, scheduled at 19:02, I decide to book my ticket for the ferry that's going to take me, two days later, from the port of Bari in Italy to Durres in Albania, in case they sell out. The only option seems to be provided by GNV, although it is sold by other shipping companies.

After pondering about it for a while, I decide not to buy a seat ticket for 50 euros, instead opting for a cabin with sea view, which is only slightly more expensive than an interior one. I know that the route I have just planned is not necessarily the one I will end up taking, but I still feel pretty confident in that ferry being my most likely option to reach Albania, as the route through Timișoara seems considerably slower, and there doesn't seem any other one arriving early from Bari or any other port in Italy.

This will be the costliest mistake I made in the race, but oblivious of that fact I get a cool Coke Zero from one of the station vending machines, and try to start making the most of the 20 minutes I have left until my train arrives by preparing a spreadsheet with my itinerary, so I can access everything (train numbers, times, PDFs of tickets...) from the same place.

The train comes packed, as I had already experienced in previous travels through Belgium, and I know there's not going to be a way to grab a seat until we arrive to Brussels. I decide to take my mind of the race for a bit, put my earbuds in, and look at the Belgian countryside for the next hour, relaxing as much as I can while standing or seating in the train doorstep.

I'm bound to the city of Hasselt, which is just 20 km away from the Belgian border. I arrive there with a seven minute delay, at 21:13. Not that I'm in a hurry: my night bus to Frankfurt doesn't depart until 00:05. I walk into town, wondering why the areas around train stations, at least in Europe, always seem to be so sketchy.

The streets of the city centre are decorated for the Virga Jesse festival, a religious festivity only held every 7 years, featuring the procession of an image of the Virgin Mary. I think to myself that it doesn't sound too different from a Spanish _verbebena_ after all.

After wondering through very empty streets, I arrive to the Market Square, where there's finally some people around. Travelling alone, and being a little tired, I give in to my worst instincts and decide to get some food from somewhere where I can order through a screen. My options seem to be a place called 'French Tacos' and KFC, and I'm ashamed to admit that I went to the later. Not that the other one was a better option, to be honest. While waiting for my sad chicken wrap to arrive, my hopes are shattered when I open the WhatsApp group shared by all racers and see that someone has posted a photo of himself in front of Cologne's cathedral just before 21:00.

That's bad. They are 100 km ahead of me, and there are a lot more transport options out of Cologne than from Hasselt, where my only real option is the bus I'm taking. What am I going to do if it gets cancelled or severely delayed? A little bit later, I would realise that it probably didn't matter. Being ahead at this point probably was important for the Berlin route, but I doubt there would be any way of getting to Rothenburg before my scheduled arrival at 8:51.

Still, I chastise myself. I have put myself in a weaker position by not questioning my route's obvious flaws: one hour in Bruges? Yes, I had time to admire the sights, but at what cost? 3 hours in Hasselt? Why couldn't I have taken a bus to Frankfurt from Brussels, where I could have alternative routes if I needed them? Or where at least I would have something to do instead of roaming in circles at night through a Belgian city I've never heard before without much to do. On the other hand, wandering aimlessly through Brussels at night didn't seem very appealing anyway.

And with more than 2 hours to kill, I do precisely that. I reminisce of my student days, where on late nights out I would have to wait to 7:30 for the metro to open to go back home, trying not to think about how I maybe had lost the race on the first day. At least it's not raining...

And, of course, five minutes later, it starts to rain. Thankfully, it's just a drizzle, as I had packed for summer weather and wasn't carrying an umbrella or anything to cover myself. I'm quite glad that I always carry a waterproof cover for my backpack, which I promptly put on, knowing that my clothes, electronics, and passport are safe.

A little bit before 23:00, I get a notification from FlixBus: my bus to Frankfurt is going to be delayed by at least 32 minutes. I expected as much, as some people had boarded it earlier and where sharing stories on the WhatsApp group about having to give directions to the driver and a very circuitous route around Brussels. While I was feeling bad about my planning for day one, I stilled was grateful that I was boarding that bus in Hasselt and not riding it for longer than I needed to.

<Figure img="hasselt-virga-jesse.jpg" caption="The Virga Jesse Basilica in Hasselt" />

After having circled the entire city centre of Hasselt at least three times, where I encountered a vigil in the [Virga Jesse Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virga_Jesse_Basilica) –quite a beautiful, albeit spooky thing, hearing chanting from outside in the middle of an otherwise empty and completely quiet street, I decide to make my way back to the station at 23:30.

It starts raining in earnest, but thankfully I'm able to seat in one of the local bus shelters. I had been smart enough to find the FlixBus stop when I first arrived, so I didn't have to look for it in the darkness and under the rain.

Trying to learn my lesson, I start researching again, trying to make up for some of the lost time. Although the bus is delayed for almost 45 minutes now, it's expected to make up the time and reach Frankfurt at the scheduled time of 5:30 AM. I manage to find a way to get there 50 minutes earlier, by stepping off the bus at the Cologne Bonn Airport and catching a train there. However, I can't find any connection departing earlier than my original 06:19 train to Würzburg.

The bus eventually arrives at 00:45, and I jump in with a couple of fellow racers that ask me what I've been doing in Hasselt for more than three hours. I honestly wander that myself too. Aboard, everybody is already sleeping. I take my jumper out of my backpack and fold it to use it as a pillow, setting myself up for sleep too. I find this much more comfortable, adjustable, and less prone to cause tons of sweat and neck pain than one of those horrific U-shaped neck pillows. I set an alarm at 2:30, before reaching Cologne Airport, and another one at 5:20, as I definitely don't want to accidentally oversleep and wake up in Prague, the bus' ultimate destination.

I can't sleep though, and I am not really surprised by that. I put my earbuds back on and look through the window, trying to see if we gain some time arriving in Maastrich, the next stop, which is just a little over 20 km away. We actually do, which is encouraging. If we get to Cologne Airport roughly in time, then it won't be necessary to change to a train there to get to Frankfurt, and I can just stay on the bus. I much prefer that option, as it's warm an cosy in there, as opposed to having to wait for more than an hour and forty minutes at Frankfurt Station at that time of the morning. I'm still awake when we reach the Airport, and I'm quite glad that we depart there much closer to schedule than I could have though possible back in Hasselt. I finally able to sleep, even if it's just for less than two hours.

At around 5:30, we arrive to Frankfurt, the bus having pulled a trick not often seen by making up a really long delay. I guess the empty roads at night make that sort of thing possible. Anyway, it's time to head from the bus to the train station, which is just around the corner. There's plenty of people around, but once again I wonder why it's always so sketchy around train stations... well, specially this one, I have to say.

I know next to nothing about Frankfurt, only that it's the financial capital of Germany, where the ECB is headquartered, and consequently where that big Euro sign that pops in the news every time there are economic problems in Europe is. I won't be able to learn more this time, though, apart from admiring it's quite grandiose train station. Well, _Hauptbahnhof_ I guess.
