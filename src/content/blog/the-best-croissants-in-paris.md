## How did we rate the croissants?
We decided to rate all croissants in five different categories:
* Aroma: a good croissant must smell like buttery heaven
* Shape and appearance, as looks aren't everything, but oh can a croissant be pretty.
* Texture: a good croissant has to be flaky, with a caramelised exterior and a soft interior. The bubbles in the dough need to be evenly spread and have an adequate size.
* Flavour: a good croissant needs o be just a little bit sweet and caramelised and have the taste of high quality butter  and a oh-so-slightly hint of yeastiness.
* Mouth feel (couldn't resist adding this ‚Äìthanks, Boyle!): the croissant has to be buttery, but not greasy, you need to fell the exterior crunch when you bite into it, and the creamy interior melting in your mouth

## The Best Croissants In Paris, Ranked

Probably the most famous croissant in the world thanks to Instagram. It is certainly the most beautiful pastry I've ever seen, but sadly it's rather underwhelming in every other aspect. Not bad, but just so boring compared with the products of all the other bakeries we tried.

If you want to try it by yourself, be prepared: they sell out pretty quickly and people queue there more than an hour before it opens in the morning. While the rest of the croissants in this list cost around ‚Ç¨1.2, this one was the most expensive at ‚Ç¨4.

It's a good idea to take your croissants away (seats are booked out long in advance), and you can go enjoy it in the beautiful Tuilleries Garden ‚Äìjust be careful with the birds, they will try and steal your expensive pastry.

**‚ú® Tip:** don't order a coffee there! It will set you back ‚Ç¨8 for a pretty standard cup, and there's a Starbucks just a minute down the road.
